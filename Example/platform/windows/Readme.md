## Overview

This is not an attempt to make an 'engine'. This is code that shows how to use Vulkan, with some helper
structures and utilities.

Making a new engine based on Vulkan is a large and extremely complicated 
undertaking.

The symbols are in namespace `vtb` "Vulkan TwoBulls". This can be overridden by setting the 
`VTB_NAMESPACE_NAME` pre-processor symbol.
